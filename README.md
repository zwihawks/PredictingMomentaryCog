#### Description of files:

1. Links to cognitive EMA tasks used for data collection (CogEMA_tasks.rtf).  
2. Data analyzed in current study (cleanData.rds).  
3. Analysis (BayesianPrediction.Rmd) and visualization (VisualizeResults.R) code.  
4. Functions sourced by analysis (BayesianPredictionFuncs.R) and visualization (VisualizeResultsFuncs.R) code.  
5. Data (analyzed using code in 3 and 4) + results associated with models that included careless and missing responses among between-person predictors (Secondary_analysis.zip).
